### Notes
I had trouble uploading the gif again and had to resort to using the code imgur had to embed the link. I also had trouble downloading cocoapods and found a helpful stack overflow guide on how to debug. Thirdly, I had issues with starting with Objective C instead of Swift because of some misleading tutorials and had to restart the project. Lastly, I was not used to using github desktop or creating a gif on my phone and learned to do those through this assignment. It was also great to learn about cocoapods, get more familiar with xcode/swift, create styled app icons, and create custom cells/tables.

Note for next time: convert to gif using the submission portal in codepath assignments - they will take the video (click drag and drop) and convert it to gif for you!
